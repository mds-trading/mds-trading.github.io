    Technology is the center of everything we do</h2>
            <p>
                Trading is tough. Market rewards those who are right and punishes those who are wrong, and we think this is very exciting! In order to make healthy and sustainable return, we must make decisions based on data and facts instead of subjective judgment, and this cannot be done in a world filled with huge amount of data without creating and using the best technologies and algorithms.</p>
            <p>
                Technology is the center of everything we do, from analyzing market data to order placement and risk control. Our in-house built, market proven, fully automated trading system enables us to constantly analyze complex market structure and profit from subtle pricing inefficiencies. As an active market participant, our trading activities supply much-needed liquidity to the market, which reduces market volatility, narrows bid/ask spread, and makes price discovery more efficient which are beneficial to all investors.</p>
            <p>
                We are a prop shop who derives its profit solely from trading. This allows us to focus entirely on improving our trading platforms. In an area where competition is fierce, our small and tight-knit teams of brilliant engineers continuously research new hardware and software technologies, come up with new ideas, implement them, test them in the real market, and watch the results instantly. This process is challenging yet rewarding, both financially and intellectually. If this excites you too, please move on to the careers page.</p>
